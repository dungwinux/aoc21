# aoc21

### Description

This is the repo for my play during Advent of Code 2021.
Like last year, a new language would be chosen to implement.
Rust is chosen for this year.

The code might not be optimized (though I left TODO notes for some of them).
Some might totally just pure brute-force, so do not expect good algorithm here.
Error handling is not considered, do not create new issue about parsing errors.
Other than that, feel free to fiddle around.

### Quick Guide:

-   To select challenge: Go to main.rs, replace all `dayXX` with the day you like.
    For example, you want to run day 8's code, replace that with `day08`.
-   To test different input, change `"dayXX/input.txt"` to whatever you want.
-   To run, do `cargo run`
-   To build, do `cargo build`
